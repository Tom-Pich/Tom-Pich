## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a web developper, working as a freelance in B2B and B2C.\
Iâ€™m currently improving my knowledge about Symfony 6.

### My philosophy
The simplier, the better. Do stuff with less code, less framework, less library.  
Simple, resilient, light-weighted, long-lasting and eco-friendly.

### My Front-End Stack

### My Back-End Stack
I also do back-end (PHP + MySQL). Iâ€™m currently working on Symfony 6.

### WordPress <img src="https://www.situp-webcreation.com/assets/img_techno/logo-wordpress.png" height="36" alt="WordPress">
I can developp WordPress themes with specific functionnalities, simple plugins and simple Gutenberg blocks.



### Apache and Linux
Iâ€™m familiar with basic configurations on Apache and basic bash commands, including SSH.\
