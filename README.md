## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a web developper, working as a freelance in B2B and B2C.\
Iâ€™m currently improving my knowledge about Symfony 6.

### My philosophy
The simplier, the better. Do stuff with less code, less framework, less library.  
Simple, resilient, light-weighted, long-lasting and eco-friendly.

### My Front-End Stack

### My CMS Stack
- WordPress : although Iâ€™m not found of WordPress, itâ€™s a must-know. I can developp pretty much everything with it (or against it?).
- Bolt CMS : although not very famous, this CMS is an excellent tool based on Symfony 5. Modern, very versatile and easy to develop specific functionalites.
- Grav CMS : lightweighted flat file CMS. Powerful and easy to learn. Not very suited for websites with lots of data, though.

### Apache and Linux
Iâ€™m familiar with basic configurations on Apache and basic bash commands, including SSH.\
