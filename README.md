## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a web developper, working as a freelance in B2B and B2C.\

### My philosophy
The simplier, the better. Do stuff with less code, less framework, less library.  
Simple, resilient, light-weighted, long-lasting and eco-friendly.

### My CMS Stack
- **ProcessWire :** the best CMS I ever worked with. Light-weighted, end-user friendly, developper friendly, with excellent performances and security out-of-the-box. Try it!  
- **WordPress :** although Iâ€™m not found of WordPress, itâ€™s a must-know. I can develop pretty much everything with it (or against it?).
